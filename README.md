👋 **Hello!** I am a cybersecurity specialist primarily focused on penetration testing.
🔍💻 However, I strive not to limit myself and therefore engage in various related areas of security. 🌐✨

My journey into security began a long time ago with attempts to hack small games during my high school years.
🎮 At that time, I often lacked professionalism, but many of my friends from that period were quite satisfied! 😄

🔍 **Penetration Testing Skills:**
* WEB Penetration Testing 🌐
* Android Application Testing 📱
* Internal Infrastructure Testing 🏢
* Active Directory Testing 🔑

💻 **Coding Skills:**
* C/C++ ⚙️
* Golang 🐹
* Python 🐍

This profile features both experimental projects 🚀 and custom-built tools 🛠️ that I use during my testing. 

🤝 Feel free to reach out if you're interested in collaboration or have any questions!
